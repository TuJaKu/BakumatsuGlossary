        Term(["anglo-satsuma war", "bombardment of kagoshima"], "Anglo-Satsuma War was fought for two days in 1863 as a result of last year's *Namamugi Incident*. The *British*, growing impatient with the *Satsuma* due to them ignoring their demands after the incident, responded by sending the Royal Navy to *Satsuma* capital of Kagoshima to force them to comply. The British initially intended to seize three British built merchant ships from *Satsuma*, their value roughly that of their demand of 25 000 pounds sterling. *Satsuma*, who had prepared for this and had evacuated the city, replied by firing on the *British* ships with coastal batteries. The *British*, unprepared for battle, took two hours to form a line of battle and then proceeded to bombard Kagoshima. *Satsuma* batteries proved ineffective against the *British*. As the British were not fully loaded for battle due to not expecting resistance, they ran out of ammunition relatively quick and retreated. *Satsuma* lost 5 dead while the *British* lost 13 dead and 69 as wounded. Satsuma claimed victory due to their low casualties, though 5/100 of Kagoshima was destroyed. Ironically, the war would improve relations between *Satsuma* and the *British*. *Satsuma* had always been one of the more pro-western *domains*, ever since the *arrival of the black ships*. *Satsuma* would pay the British demand of 25 000 pounds sterling and would sign a contract with the British, who would provide them with warships.

        Term(["ansei purge"], "Ansei Purge was a purge ordered by *tairo* *Ii Naosuke* against people harboring anti-*bakufu* sentiment during 1858-1860, which greatly increased after the singing of the *Ansei Treaties*.

        Term(["ansei treaties", "harris treaty", "treaty of amity and commerce"], "Ansei treaties *unequal treaties* which Japan signed with *France*, *Netherlands*, *Russia*, *United Kingdom* and *United States* in 1858. The treaties opened Japanese ports for free trade by the signatories (besides opium, which was prohibited), guaranteed *extraterritoriality* for western citizens, established diplomatic relations and put low tariffs on trade. The treaties were highly opposed by many Japanese harboring anti-western sentiment, particularly as the *bakufu* had sign without acceptance by the *emperor*. The *bakufu would reply to this with the *Ansei Purge*."),
        Term(["artisans", "artisan"], "Artisans (職人, shokunin) were the second lowest of the official *classes*, below the *peasants* and above the *merchants*. This is due to the fact that while they do produce commodities, they do not produce food, the most essential commodity. Similar to *merchants*, they generally lived in their own quarters in urban areas and despite being one of the lower *classes*, they were still capable of gathering wealth surpassing that of some of the lower members of the higher *classes*"),
        Term(["battle of sekigahara"], "Battle of Sekigahara (関ヶ原の戦い), fought in year 1600, was the largest battle ever fought on Japanese main islands which ended the *Sengoku-period* and created the *Tokugawa*-*Bakufu*.

While the *imperial court*, consisting of the *emperor* and the *kuge*, were the official leadership of Japan, throughout the feudal period, the real power was in the hands of the bakufu. The bakufu during the *Edo-period* was headed by the *Tokugawa-clan*."),
        Term(["black ships", "perry expedition", "arrival of the black ships"], "One of the single most important events in Japanese history happened in 1853 when over 200 years of Japanese isolation under the *sakoku*-policy were brought to an end by the arrival of the *American* Perry Expedition. Led by commodore *Matthew C. Perry*, these black ships (黒船, kurofune) as they became known in Japan due to their tar-laden black hulls and steam engines, were sent by the *United States* to force Japan to open its borders for trade. These ships greatly frightened the Japanese, thanks to their black smoke, capability to move against wind, guns capable of firing explosive ammunition and their sheer size, many times larger than even the biggest Japanese ships. *Perry* ignored requests to move to *Dejima*, where trade with the west was conducted by the *Dutch* and instead threatened to destroy the *bakufu* capital of *Edo* if their demands were not met. Through double translation, he told Japanese that he would return a year later with even more ships and would not leave before he had a treaty. The Perry Expedition returned in 1854 with twice the number of ships slightly ahead of time and after a month of negotiations, the Japanese signed the *Convention of Kanagawa*. With the arrival of the black ships, the *Bakumatsu* had begun."),

        Term(["class-system summarized", "class", "classes"], "*Edo-period* Japan was a country largely defined by its strict feudal class-system, where people are born in their class and advancement is extremely difficult. At the top of the class was the *emperor* and below him the court-nobility, the *kuge*. They had however, little real power. The real power was in the hands of the *shogun*, the military dicator of Japan, and the *daimyo*, the feudal lords. Below them was the *samurai*-class, the warrior caste of Japan, though *shogun and *daimyo* were considered samurai as well. Below them were the commoners, the *peasants*, *artisans* and the *merchants*. Collectively, *samurai*, *peasants*, *artisans* and *merchants* were known as the four classes."),
        Term(["chonmage"], "Chonmage (丁髷, town topknot) is a topknot hairstyle which *samurai* were expected to have when on official business. While, originally it was used to keep the helmet steady during battle, later during the *Edo Period*, together with *daisho*, it became one of the most recognizeable symbols of the *samurai*-class. *Ronin* however, generally did not have them, as it is a hairstyle difficult to apply without a barber. "), 
        Term(["daimyo", "daimyou"], "Daimyo (大名, great name) were the feudal rulers of Japan, in charge of the slightly under 300 *domains*. The daimyo-class was further divided into three classes of its own, the *fudai*, *shinpan* and *tozama*. Though the daimyo held significant amounts of autonomy within their *domains*, to assure their loyalty, the daimyo were forced to live under a system of *sankin-kotai* (参勤交代, alternate attendance), under which they had to alternate between living one year in the *Bakufu*-capital of *Edo* and one year in their own *domain*. While in their own *domain*, their family will be held hostage in *Edo*." ),
        Term(["daisho", "daishou"], "Daisho, meaning big-small (大小) referred to carrying two swords, a long and a short one, generally an *uchigatana* and a *wakizashi* at once. While this was originally for reasons of practicality on the battlefield (as a long sword might be too long to be used effectively in-doors), in the *Edo-Period* this became a symbol of the *samurai*-class who were the only ones allowed to carry a daisho. It was customary to leave the long sword at the door when entering a building while still carrying the short one."),
        Term(["dappan"], "Dappan (脱藩, escape domain) refers to an act of a *samurai* leaving their *domain* without a permission from their lord, thus becoming *ronin*.

        Term(["domain", "han", "domains"], "Domains (藩, han) are the fiefs ruled over by the *daimyo*. A major difference between western feudal fiefs and Japanese domains is how their value is determined.

Doshin serve under a *yoriki*, effectively a police sergeant."),
        Term(["emperor"], "The Emperor of Japan (天皇, tennō) officially existed at the top of the class system. In practice however, he was only a figurehead, as he had been for most of the last 1000 years, with the real power being in hands of the *samurai*-class, the highest ranking of whom, the *shogun*, being the de facto head of state. Despite this, the Emperor was given enormous amounts of respect as the cultural and spiritual leader of Japan."),
        Term(["edo"], "Edo (江戸) was a city in eastern Japan which, as the residence of the *shogun*, served as the de-facto capital of Japan while *Kyoto* in western Japan, as the residence of the *emperor*, served as the official capital. Due to this, the entire period when it served as the capital was known as the *Edo-period* Though primarily known for this role, Edo also gained an unfortunate reputation as the city of fire, due to the several city fires which ravaged the city multiple times throughout the *Edo-period*. After the *bakumatsu*, the *emperor* moved to Edo. Since then, it has been known as Tokyo, (東京, eastern capital)."),

        Term(["eta", "burakumin"], "Eta (穢多, dirty many) were people who existed outside the official *class* system as an unofficial untouchables class. They dealt in hereditary professions that were considered taboo, generally ones which involve working with corpses of both humans and animals, such as undertakers, executioners, butchers, tanners and slaugherhouse workers and lived in their own isolated communities. Due to this, they faced heavy discrimination from the rest of the society."),
        Term(["extraterritoriality"], "Extraterritoriality is a right guaranteed to the western signatories of the *Ansei Treaties*. By extraterritorial right, westerners will by judged by their own law when they are in a Japan, rather than Japan's own laws. Western powers signed treaties guaranteeing extraterritoriality with other Asian countries as well."),
        Term(["first choshu expedition"], "The First Choshu Expedition was a punitive expidition by the *bakufu* against the *Choshu* *Domain* for their role in the *Kinmon Incident*, consisting of forces from the *domains* of *Satsuma* and *Aizu*, who helped put down the rebellion, but also of *bakufu* itself. The expedition was a nominal success, as the leader of the *Satsuma* army, *Saigo Takamori*, succeeded to negotiate the handover of the leaders of the rebellion. Thus the expedition was completed with a fight, which neither the *Satsuma* nor the *Aizu* were particularly interested in."),
        Term(["fudai"], "Fudai (譜代, successive generations) were *Daimyo* whose ancestors supported the *Tokugawa*-family before the decisive *Battle of Sekigahara* in 1600. Due to this, they were considered more trustworthy than those who only started supporting the *Tokugawa* after the battle, the *Tozama* and as a result, they held higher positions and typically had wealthier *domains* than the *Tozama*. Their *domains* were also generally more strategically placed and closer to the *Bakufu*-capital of *Edo*."),
        Term(["gatling gun", "gatling"], "Gatling gun is a weapon developed by the *American* inventor Richard Gatling in 1861 and one of the predecessors of the machine gun. The gatling gun uses multiple barrels where loading, firing and extraction can be performed on separate barrels. It is not however, a true machine gun, due to it being operated with a handcrank. It was first used during the *United States* Civil War but would also be using in Japan during the *Boshin War*, where the *Bakufu* managed to acquire two of them while the imperial side managed to acquire one."),
        Term(["gokenin"], "(御家人, honorable house person) are *samurai* and lower ranking vassals of the *shogun*. Unlike higher ranking vassals, *hatamoto*, a gokenin could not request an audience with the *shogun*"),

        Term(["Ii Naosuke", "Naosuke Ii"], "Ii Naosuke was a *daimyo* and a *tairo* who signed the *Ansei Treaties* on behalf of the *Bakufu*. This greatly upset those who harbored anti-western sentiment, which led to Naosuke ordering the *Ansei Purge* to deal with disloyalty against the *bakufu*. This purge would ultimately lead to his assassination during the *Sakuradamon Incident*."), 
        Term(["james stirling"], "When the *United Kingdom* heard that *Russia*, against whom they were engaged in the Crimean War, was trying to establish a foothold in Japan, they got a bit concerned. As a result, vice admiral Sir James Stirling led a fleet to Japan, aiming to engage the *Russian* fleet Japan and to ensure Japan's neutrality. The *bakufu* was cautious about the appearance of the *British*, as they had heard about what they had done to China during the Opium War. Stirling wanted to make sure that Japanese ports would be closed to *Russia* at least for as long as the Crimean War went on, even if this meant denying them to *British* as well. Ultimately, the *Bakufu* agreed that an agreement with the *British* could offset *Russia*'s ambitions for the Kuril Islands, where the Japanese also had interests. Thus, Stirling managed to negotiate the *Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty*."),

        Term(["kirisutegomen"], "Kirisutegomen (切捨御免, authorization to cut and leave) refers to a special right of the *samurai* to attack and kill members of the lower *classes* if they felt they had not been given appropriate. It did have some strict rules however: it must be carried out immediately after an offense with a single strike with a sword and it must have a witness.  The *samurai* is also expected to report having carried it out and to spend 20 days at home after it. Doctors and midwives were not eligibile targets for kirisutegomen. If it is found out that kirisutegomen was not justified, it would be treated as an assault or a homicide and punished accordingly."),

Leading the *Perry Expedition*, he played a leading role towards forcing Japan to end its *Sakoku*-policy of self-imposed isolation and starting the *bakumatsu*.

        Term(["merchants", "merchant"], "Merchants (商人, shōnin) existed at the bottom of the official *class* system.

At the time, commoners were expected to stand still on the edge of the road and bow down when a samurai retinue passes. Richardson, unaware of this and legally not obligated to do so thanks to the *Ansei Treaties* which guarantee *extraterritoriality*, instead continued to ride on his horse in the middle of the road and was attacked and killed when he got close to the retinue. While the Satsuma defended their action, saying they were simply performing the legal act of *kirisutegomen*, the *British* were outraged by this violation of their *extraterritoriality* and demanded reparations from the *Bakufu* and *Satsuma*, as well as arrest, trial and execution of the perpetrators. While the *Bakufu* paid a sum of 100 000 pounds sterling (third of their annual income), worrying that the *British* would bombard *Edo*, *Satsuma* continued to ignore all *British* demands. This would lead to the *Anglo-Satsuma War*."),
        Term(["netherlands", "dutch", "holland"], "When Japan entered *sakoku*, policy of isolation, Netherlands remained the sole western country they had contact with. This was primarily due to Dutch willingless to solely focus on trade, whereas the catholic nations of Spain and Portugal also wanted to convert Japan to christianity. The sole place where the Dutch were allowed to conduct trade was the artifical island of *Dejima* (thus the Dutch were technically not in Japan, keeping in line with *sakoku*) in Nagasaki, where the *Bakufu* could keep a close eye on them. Through *rangaku*, (蘭学, Dutch studies), Japan remained aware of developments outside their country, which allowed the country to modernize fast once they ended their isolation. After the arrival of the *black ships, Netherlands would lose their de facto monopoly over trade with Japan, with other western powers establishing trade with Japan as well. After this, the Dutch would be one of the five countries to sign the *Ansei Treaties*. The Dutch would also help Japan construct the *Kankō Maru*, Japan's first steam-powered warship.

They generally hold the rank of *gokenin*. Popular culture typically portrays them as ninja, which goes back to the time they were around. It was not completely baseless either, as Oniwaban could generally trace their lineage back to the ninja who were active during the *Sengoku-period*."),
        Term(["order to expel the barbarians"], "In 1863, *Emperor* *Komei* gave the order to expel the barbarians (攘夷勅命, joi chokumei). This was significant, since for centuries, the *emperor* had been a mere figurehead of the *shogun* and was not involved in politics. While the *sonno joi* movement had been going for years by this point, the movement gained new traction now that the emperor had given his support. *Bakufu* ignored the order, which serves as further prove to the *sonno joi* movement that the *bakufu* no longer works serves the *Emperor*. The order would lead to increase on attacks against westerners and pro-western officials.

Unlike other *samurai*, they serve no lords or masters, having either lost their masters or severed ties with them. As becoming a ronin means also losing access to stipends, they have to make ends meet in some other ways. Often this leads to ronin becoming mercenaries or bodyguards or sometimes even bandits or members of organized crime. A ronin can often be recognized from other samurai by their lack of *chonmage*. While usually they do so unwillingly, some *samurai* willingly become ronin due to the strict conduct and lifestyle they had to follow under a master."),

Relations between Russian and Japan would deteriorate from there. In 1861, they tried to take the island of Tsushima from Japan as an year-round ice-free port. In what became known as the *Tsushima Incident*, the Russians failed largely due to *British* interference. Even after the *Bakumatsu*, the relations between Japan and Russia would get even worse, culminating in the Russo-Japanese in 1904-1905, which ended in a humiliating defeat for Russia and rise of Japan as a great power."),

Another notable exception was the *Ryukyu Kingdom*, a vassal-state of the *Satsuma Domain*."),
        Term(["samurai"], "Samurai (侍) were the hereditary warrior caste of Japan, existing above commoners but below the aristocracy and they made up around 1/10 of Edo Japan's population. Though officially a *class* of warriors, due to the peaceful *Edo period*, they have largely become bureaucrats and civil servants. It was prohibited for a samurai to leave the *domain* of their lord, an act known as *dappan* and doing so would lead to them cutting all ties with their master, becoming *ronin*, masterless samurai. One of the notable symbols of their class is the *daisho*, act of carrying two swords, a long and short one, at once and only they were allowed to do so. They were also excepted to have their hair in a *chonmage*-topknot when on official business. Their position grants them certain privileges, such as exemption from taxation and gaining income through stipends. Any commoners are expected to treat them with highest respect and if they did not, the samurai could carry out *kirisutegomen*, allowing them to kill commoners for disrespect. If a samurai was found guilty of a capital offense, they were expected to carry out *seppuku*, ritual suicide. Samurai-*class* itself was divided into *classes* of its own, including *hatamoto*, *gokenin*, *joshi*, *goshi* and *ronin*.

Led by the *daimyo* of the Shimazu-clan, they fought against the *tokugawa* during the *Battle of Sekigahara*, which made them *tozama* *daimyo*. They held somewhat of a unique position due to them turning the nearby *Ryukyu Kingdom* into their vassal state, which allowed them to get around some of the limitations of the *sakoku*-policy. During the *bakumatsu*, the Satsuma would initially align themselves with the *bakufu* but thanks to negotiations by *Sakamoto Ryoma*, Satsuma would align themselves with the rival *Choshu Domain* against the *Bakufu*, forming the *Saccho-Alliance*, which would defeat the *bakufu* during the *Boshin War* and establish the Empire of Japan."),
        Term(["seppuku", "harakiri"], "Seppuku (切腹, stomach cutting) is a Japanese ritual suicide which can be committed by the *samurai*. While originally committed primarily to avoid capture and torture, by the *Edo-period* it had developed into a full ritual which a *samurai* who had committed capital offense can be ordered to perform, or may volunteer to perform which may lessen the punishment to his clan. To perform seppuku, a *samurai* would bathe, dress up in white clothes, enjoy a last meal and write a death poem. They would then cut a horizontal wound through their stomach and then up towards the chest and if still able, do the motion again in other direction. An assistant, kaishakunin (介錯人), would then strike their head with a sword. The cut should ideally be deep enough to kill but not deep enough to decapitate. In later times, titular stomach cutting would be omitted from the ritual. Instead, reaching for the blade would message the kaishakunin to perform a killing blow. Sometimes the blade would be omitted completely, especially if the one performing seppuku is too old to cut their stomach or is too dangerous to be given a weapon, in which cases they would signal the kaishakunin by touching something, such as a fan. A commoner accused of similar crimes would never be ordered to commit seppuku. Instead, a less severe capital offense would be punished with decapitation with a sword, while a more severe would be punished with a more gruesome method of execution, such as crucifixion or boiling."),
        Term(["shimonoseki war", "shimonoseki campaign", "bombardment of shimonoseki"], "Shimonoseki War was a series of engagements fought for the control of Shimonoseki Straits, located between the Japanese islands of Honshu and Kyushu and a passage for most ships traveling from ports of *Edo* and *Yokohama* to mainland Asia. The war had an alliance of western powers, consisting of *France*, *Netherlands*, *United Kingdom* and *United States*, fighting against the Japanese *domain* of *Choshu*. *Choshu*, one of the most pro-*sonno joi* *domains, responded to *Emperor* *Komei*'s *Order to Expel the Barbarian* in 1863 by beginning to fire without warning an all foreign ships travesing the straits. *Choshu*, within a short timeframe, would fire on ships flying flags of nearly all the foreign nations present in Japan. Once word got out of it, despite minor attempts to open it, the straits remained closed for the rest of 1863 and most of 1864 as the western powers sought diplomatic solutions, though with no effect. Thus, the western powers started forming an alliance to reopen the straits. Bulk of it would consist of *British* and *Dutch*. *France* was engaged in a war in Mexico and thus unwilling to fully commit to a war in Japan. The *United States* was in the middle of a civil war and thus joined the alliance mostly symbolically. In august of 1864, the alliance attacked the straits with 16 warships and 2000 men. The battle was completely one-sided, as the navy bombarded *Choshu* positions which were then taken over by the marines. *Choshu* completely lost its ability to fight the western powers. After the war, the alliance would demand reparations of 3 million US dollars. *Bakufu* was unable to pay this, which led to more ports being opened for trade and lower tariffs"),
        Term(["shinpan"], "Shinpan (親藩, relative clan) were *Daimyo* who were relatives to the *Tokugawa*-family but outside the mainline of succession to become *Shogun*.

        Term(["shogun"], "The shogun (将軍, general), also known by his full title Sei-I Taishogun, (征夷大将軍, the great barbarian-subjugating general), was the military dictator of Japan. Though officially below the *Emperor* and the *Kuge*, in practice, he was the highest leader of Japan during the Feudal period. Since 1603, the position of the Shogun was held by the *Tokugawa*-clan."),
        Term(["sodegarami"], "Sodegarami (袖搦, sleeve entangler) is a non-lethal pole weapon used by the *police*-officials to catch suspects unharmed. As the name suggests, it is used to entangle the suspects sleeves and clothing to make them easier to capture. Barbs along the pole make it difficult for the suspect to grab the weapon. Together with *sasumata* and *tsukubo* it forms the *mitsudogu*, three tools of arrest."),
        Term(["sonno joi", "sonnou joui"], "Sonno Joi (尊王攘夷) or revere the *emperor*, expel the barbarians, was a political movement and a slogan used by those who believed that as the *bakufu* had become weak due to it bowing down to the demands of the western powers after signing of the *Convention of Kanagawa*, power must be returned to the emperor while the westerners must be expelled from Japan. Many proponents of sonno joi would engage in violence against both westerners and the *bakufu*. *Emperor* *Komei* supported the movement and the movement would reach its peak after he gave an *order to expel the barbarians*."),
        Term(["tairo", "tairou"], "Tairo (大老, great elder) is the highest ranking position in the *bakufu* besides the *shogun* himself, comparable to a prime minister, though the position is not always occupied, generally appointed during emergencies. The tairo works closely with the *shogun* and should the *shogun* either be incapable of performing his duties or he dies and a successor has yet to be appointed, the tairo will temporarily serve as the ruler of Japan. Notable tairo was *Ii Naosuke*, who signed the *Harris Treaty* with the *United States* and was assassinated by *shishi* as a result during the *Sakuradamon Incident*."),
        Term(["tosa-han", "tosa", "tosa-domain", "Yamauchi-clan", "Yamauchi"], "Tosa-han(土佐藩) or Tosa-domain was a *domain* in south Japan on the island of Shikoku. At the end of the *Sengoku-period*, it was ruled by the Chosokabe-clan. The Chosokabe fought against the *Tokugawa* during the *Battle of Sekigahara*. As a result, after the battle, they lost control of Tosa to the Yamauchi-clan. When the Yamauchi took over, they imposed a strict segregation between their own *samurai*, who became *joshi*, and the Chosokabe samurai, who became *goshi*, who faced strict discrimination from the *joshi*. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Tosa was the home to many prominent *shishi* during the *Bakumatsu*, most notably among them *Sakamoto Ryoma*."),
        Term(["tozama"], "Tozama (外様, outsider) are *daimyo* who only swore allegiance to the *Tokugawa* family after the *Battle of Sekigahara* in 1600, some of whom fought against the *Tokugawa* during the battle. Due to this, they are of weaker position than other classes of *daimyo*, the *shinpan* and the *fudai* and their *domains* are located further away from the *bakufu* capital of *Edo* and in less strategic locations and are often poorer as well."),       
        Term(["treaty of shimoda"], "Treaty of Shimoda, more formally Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Japan and *Russia*, was a treaty signed between Japan and *Russia* in 1855, soon after Japan had signed a similar *Convention of Kanagawa* with *United States*. The treaty, negotiated on the *Russian* side by *Yevfimy Putyatin*, opened the cities of Nagasaki, Shimoda and *Hakodate* for trade by *Russia*, established position of *Russian* consuls and defined borders between Japan and *Russia*."), 
        Term(["tsukubo", "tsukubou"], "Tsukubo (突棒, push pole) is a rake-shaped non-lethal pole weapon used by the *police* officials to catch suspects unharmed. It can be used to push, pull and trip suspects and the business end contains numerous barbs to prevent the suspect from grabbing the weapon. Together with *sasumata* and *sodegarami*, it forms the *mitsudogu*, three tools of arrest."),
        Term(["tsushima incident"], "In 1860, *Russia* established the city of Vladivostok in East-Asia. Despite now having a port city in the east, they still had a problem in that Vladivostok is not usable as a port throughout a year, since it freezes during winter. Thus they had to acquire a warm water port elsewhere. They looked towards the island of Tsushima between Korea and Japan for this, which was under Japanese control. This concerned the *bakufu*, who had already had problems with *Russia* in Ezo (now Hokkaido) and Tsushima under Russian control would only make things worse. Japan thus asked help from the *British*, who were already fighting *Russia* over influence in Central Asia and were also concerned with Russia gaining more influence in the east. Through *British* assistance, *Russians* were driven from Tsushima with relatively little fighting and the incident was solved."),
        Term(["uchigatana", "katana"], "Uchigatana (打刀, striking sword) is one of the most recognizeable swords in history. In the west, this type of sword is generally known simply as katana (刀), which in Japanese simply means sword. Uchigatana is a two-handed single-edged sword with a slight curve. Uchigatana is well known for its production methods, where steel is constantly folded to remove impurities. In the earlier *Sengoku-Period*, when warfare was constant, uchigatana was primarily worn as a backup weapon, with a polearm, bow or an *arquebus* carried as the primary weapon. In the peaceful *Edo-Period*, it instead became one of the symbols of the *samurai*-class and became the weapon samurai most extensively trained with. Samurai generally carried their swords in a *daisho*, where the uchigatana was worn together with the shorter *wakizashi*"),
        Term(["unequal treaty", "unequal treaties"], "Unequal treaties are treaties which the western powers forced on Asian countries in the 19th century. These one-sided treaties did things such as open ports for trade and guarantee *extraterritoriality* for western citizens. Notable examples of unequal treaties Japan was forced to sign with the western powers include the *Convention of Kanagawa*, *Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty*, *Treaty of Shimoda* and the *Ansei Treaties*."),

While this treaty was considered satisfactory in the short term, it was later replaced with a more *unequal treaty*, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce, one of the *Ansei Treaties*. The British would assist Japan in solving the *Tsushima Incident*, when Russia attempted to establish a base on the island of Tsushima between Japan and Korea. United Kingdom and Japan would still find themselves at odds, most notably during the *Bombardment of Kagoshima* and *Shimonoseki Campaign*. After Bakumatsu, Japan and United Kingdom would maintain a close relationship, with the latter helping Japan build a modern navy. British would also help Japan construct its railroads. Today, the legacy of this can be seen in Japan's left-driving traffic."), 
        Term(["united states", "america", "us", "usa", "americans"], "More than 200 years of Japanese isolation were brought to an end in year 1853 when the *Perry Expedition* led by commodore *Matthew Perry* arrived in Japan aboard what became known in Japan as the *Black Ships*, starting the historical period of *bakumatsu*. The mission of the Perry Expedition was the force Japan to end its isolation and open up its ports for trade with the United States. They returned a year later with more ships, forcing Japan to sign the *unequal treaty* called the *Convention of Kanagawa*. In 1856, *Townsend Harris* was appointed as consul general, who further exposed Japan to western trade and culture. While the United States would maintain a presence in Japan throughout the *bakumatsu*, notably during the *Shimonoseki Campaign*, their role in it dimished as it went on, particularly once a civil war began in United States in 1861."),
        Term(["wakizashi"], "Wakizashi (脇差, side-inserted) is a short sword with a single edged and a curved blade. While the longer *uchigatana* is more iconic, the wakizashi was the most popular sword in feudal Japan, as it was carried by everyone who could afford one for self-defense, whereas the *uchigatana* was mostly used by the higher classes, most notably the *samurai*, who carried both types of swords together in an assortment known as *daisho*."),
        Term(["yevfimy putyatin"], "*Russia* had made plans to make contact with the Japanese in the 1840s, ten years before the arrival of the *American* *Black Ships* in 1853, in an expedition which would have been led by admiral Yefvimy Putyatin. They initially chose not to do so, thinking it would disrupt their trade with China, known as Kyakhta trade. After hearing of *American* plans to make contact with Japan, Russia reconsidered it and decided to send Putyatin to Japan. His fleet arrived in Nagasaki a month after the *Black Ships*. During the Russian visit in Nagasaki, they would demonstrate a steam engine to the Japanese, allowing them to reverse engineer it and make their own. Tired of slow progress on negotiations due to distance between Nagasaki and *Edo*, they would sail to the port of Shimoda closer to Edo. The Russians would see their fleet destroyed there due to a major earthquake and a tsunami, stranding them in Japan. During this, the Russians would complete negotiations on the *Treaty of Shimoda* while they worked with the Japanese to construct a ship on which they could leave Japan. Leaving Japan on the schooner Heda, the Russian expedition returned to Russia, where Putyatin received a hero's welcome. He would later return to Japan to negotiate another treaty, the Russian *Ansei Treaty*."),
