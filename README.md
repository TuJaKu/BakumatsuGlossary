A glossary of key terms from the **Bakumatsu period (1853-1869)**, the final years of the Edo period in Japan. Content is incomplete but the code portion is done.

## About This Project

The project was inspired by the 2023 video game **Like a Dragon: Ishin!**, set during the Bakumatsu period, which features a glossary I found lacking. I decided to create my own, possibly to share with my friends and others who do not know much about the period.

## Features

-Easily searchable terms related to the Bakumatsu-period, from samurai to foreign powers

-Multiple pseudonyms for the same entry (e.g. searching for America and United States leads to the same entry)

-Flexible display options:  
  - View all searchable terms at once  
  - Browse by categories to find relevant terms
